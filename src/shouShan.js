    overview: "Shou Shan is a limestone mountain located in a nature park to the north of Kaohsiung city. The nature park contains a number of different climbing areas, many of which are in narrow valleys with high walls on both sides which provide lots of shade. The climbs here are almost exclusively bolted sport routes on densely pocketed overhanging walls with the occasional drippy feature. Since most of the climbing areas are collapsed cave features, the lower portions of the walls often retain moisture, making them slick to the touch after long wet periods. The winter typically brings weeks of sunshine and lower temperatures. Please be mindful that the nature park, while aware of the climbing activity, has no official management plan. Access could be denied at any time. For the latest information regarding access or to find climbing partners, please refer to the Facebook group below.",
    travel: "From the Longquan Temple Trail Entrance (龙泉寺登山口, GPS coordinates 22.655417, 120.273204), walk along the boardwalk for about 10 minutes to the first split at a pavilion. Stay right here and continue for another 4 minutes to another fork. Go left (uphill) and continue for another 12 minutes to another fork. There will be a sign about snakes, a sign-post, a map, and an obvious bare trail going off to the right. Follow this, staying left on the most obvious trail, until you cut left along a narrow path that quickly arrives at the entrance of Skyline. Continue past this and turn left, following a faint path through the jungle to Hobo Wall and White Wall. Turn right slightly further along to reach AC Wall and eventually Dirty Wall.",
